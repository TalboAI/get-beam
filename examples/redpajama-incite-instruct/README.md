# RedPajama-INCITE deployment with Beam

[RedPajama-INCITE](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Instruct-3B-v1) can be run on the cloud with a single command, using Beam.

1. [Create an account on Beam](https://beam.cloud). It's free and you don't need a credit card.

2. Install the Beam CLI:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slai-labs/get-beam/main/get-beam.sh -sSfL | sh
```

3. Clone this example to your computer:

```python
beam create-app redpajama-incite-instruct
```

4. Deploy and run inference:

```python
beam deploy app.py
```

This example is called through a webhook. Webhooks are used for deploying
functions that run asynchronously on Beam. Here, the webhook takes a prompt
as one of its input fields. An example prompt and the real response from the
model are given below.

Example prompt:
> Tell me about transistors.

Example response: 
>  In order to reduce the cost of production of semiconductor devices, the use of a thin film transistor (TFT) is increasing. A TFT is a semiconductor device that can be formed on a substrate by a thin film process. The TFT has a channel region and a source and drain regions. The channel region is a region where electrons and holes are generated by the action of an electric field. The source and drain regions are regions where electrons and holes are injected.
