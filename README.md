# Get Started

The `examples` folder in this repo contains various examples of programs built with Beam. 

You can run any of these examples yourself. All you need is a free account on [Beam](https://beam.cloud).

# What can you do with Beam?

* üõ∞ **Develop locally on remote hardware**. Beam provides a brand new type of cloud development experience. You can write code on your laptop and execute it on cloud hardware immediately, with lightning fast build times.
* üì¶ **Instantly containerize any Python function and run it on a GPU.** Configure your runtime in Python - tell us how many GPUs you need and which libraries you want installed, and Beam will spawn a remote environment for you.
* üöÄ **Deploy apps as serverless functions**. Deploy your apps as serverless REST APIs, scheduled cron jobs, or task queues - all with just a single line of Python. It's great for deploying [LangChain](https://docs.beam.cloud/examples/langchain) apps, [Stable Diffusion APIs](https://docs.beam.cloud/examples/stable-diffusion-gpu), or [Dreambooth](https://docs.beam.cloud/examples/dreambooth).
* ‚è∞ **Run scheduled jobs**. You can run any code on a schedule, and do things like [train machine learning models](https://docs.beam.cloud/examples/recommendation-system) and setup [data pipelines on S3 buckets](https://docs.beam.cloud/examples/s3-schedule).
* üóÇÔ∏è **Mount storage volumes**. Read and write data to highly-performant distributed file systems.
